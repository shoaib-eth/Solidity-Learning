// Let's assume the ReentrancyVictim contract has 10 ether initially.
// The attacker deploys the ReentrancyAttacker contract with the address of the ReentrancyVictim contract.
// The attacker calls the attack function of the ReentrancyAttacker contract, sending 1 ether.
// The ReentrancyAttacker contract deposits 1 ether into the ReentrancyVictim contract.
// The ReentrancyAttacker contract then calls the withdraw function of the ReentrancyVictim contract.
// The ReentrancyVictim contract sends 1 ether to the ReentrancyAttacker contract and calls its receive function.
// The receive function checks if the ReentrancyVictim contract has at least 1 ether and calls the withdraw function again.
// This process repeats until the ReentrancyVictim contract has no ether left.
